## Bio

I have been fascinated by complex and networked systems, the web and online-community development. For more than 20 years, as a dancer, digital artist and educator, I have always been interested in building systems with rules and software, creating community platforms and establishing collaborations. I have always been driven by curiosity and my capacity to see the whole and its parts. I have learned to move fast and efficiently from large scale problems, such as networks to the specificities of software implementation. I have lots of collaborative experience envisioning, engineering, coordinating and passion for deploying cutting edge international projects intersecting software, culture and people. I am fascinated by the potential of the blockchain for financial inclusion and innovation. I am a graduate of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program (December 2021) and a Kernel Fellow Block5 2022. I love creative coding and I teach vipassana meditation and yoga.

# Full Stack Development Projects

I have developed several projects with modern web development frameowrks.

# Collections
## VANILLA JAVASCRIPT PROJECTS

<img width="1408" alt="github" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/170297745-6f318c44-81b1-4e42-8954-faad6ce730f9.png">

This is a collection of projects as practice on the versatility and power of Vanilla or pure Java Script in combination with HTML5 and CSS3. The projects are linked to their LIVE apps and code REPOs. Enjoy

## CREATIVE CODING AND GENERATIVE ART

![Screen Shot 2022-05-24 at 9 05 50 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/170304140-15ee0f3b-e0d8-44fe-9d0a-8a186422cac0.png)

This is a collection with fun projects using p5.js exploring simulation of complex systems and emergence properties aith autonomous agents and interactivity.
Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the generative system represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.
Creative coding is a type of computer programming in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional. It is used to create live visuals and for VJing, as well as creating visual art and design, entertainment (e.g. video games), art installations, projections and projection mapping, sound art, advertising, product prototypes, and much more.

# Web3/Web2 Online Communities Projects

## MotionDAO

![31c98a5e05fee9aa7d9898ef4a1e14558ead6840](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/170337857-32e586d6-89d8-47c4-84bb-8be3bcaafb8d.png)

As a founder and leader of MotionDAO the founder, I facilitate contexts of adoption and creative experimentation using Web3 technologies; investigating its impacts on ownership, governance and value creation within local and global communities of artists; MotionDAO operates supported and supporting the social networks dance-tech.net and movimiento.org. MotionDAO is part of the Near Protocol ecosystem.

[MotionDAO in Notion](https://olive-continent-a23.notion.site/MotionDAO-A-WEB3-Dancing-Ecosystem-6e9b46865dcd4021a1d4077fcffb9f3f 'MotionDAO')


## Dance-tech.net Project
![Dance-tech.net](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/170344274-3d451c01-4942-41fa-8fa1-79a9d3ddd3dc.png)

I have developed and curated social networks since 2008. The dance-tech,ne (English) and movimiento.org (in Spanish and Portuguese) have explored the potential of the new Internet technologies for knowledge production and distribution on body based artistic practices and it's intersections with other disciplines such as new media, architecture, philosophy, anthropology and more. All dance-tech projects attempt to situate embodiment as a fundamental condition and movement arts relevant practices of the contemporary with an interdisciplinary framework.

# Teaching and Research
## UnstableLandscape | Art + Tech + P2P + Blockchain

![Screen Shot 2022-02-25 at 8 18 34 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/170346044-60243b6e-7764-45ea-8253-1d4f76036ca2.png)

As an interdisciplinary artist and researcher working in the intersection of dance, computation, networks, cognitive science and blockchain studies, I teach and consult for universities, arts centers, corporations, festivals and thinktanks.
