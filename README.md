## Sumary

I am an interdiciplinary artist, creative technologist, researcher and educator with passion for complexity, networked systems, movement arts, contemplative practices, social innovation and community development. I danced profesionaly for more than 20 years and I have done research on embodied cognition, movement improvisation, awareness practices, interactive multimedia systems, human-computer interaction, aesthetic coding, netwoked sociotechnical systems/bottom-up architectures for creative processes, knowledge transmission and care. I am fascinated by the possibilities of P2P technologies and the blockchain for artictic practices and its implications for governance, ownership, the commons and social change. I am the creator of [dance-tech.net and MotionDAO.](https://marlonbarrios.github.io/#web3web-20-online-communities-development)

I have been interested in creating platforms with a p2p architecture and establishing collaborations. I have always been driven by curiosity and my capacity to see the whole and its parts. I have learned to move fast and efficiently from large scale problems, such as networks to the specificities of software implementation. I have lots of collaborative experience envisioning, engineering, coordinating and passion for deploying cutting edge international projects intersecting software, culture and people. 

Currently, I am developing applications with modern JavaScript frameworks exploring the potential of WEBXR, WEBGL, ML for mixed reality experiences, blockchain and weareables. Power to the browser!

## RESEARCH, TEACHING and WRITING

## UnstableLandscape | Art + Tech + P2P + Blockchain + Generativity

![Screen Shot 2022-02-25 at 8 18 34 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/170346044-60243b6e-7764-45ea-8253-1d4f76036ca2.png)

As an interdisciplinary artist and researcher working in the intersection of dance, computation, networks, cognitive science and blockchain studies, I teach and consult for universities, arts centers, corporations, festivals and thinktanks. I use improvisational/performance games, interactive media, somatics, vipassana meditation and design thinking as part of my facilitation toolbox and pedagogy: UnstableLandscape. I led workshops and labs in North, Central and South America, North Africa, Middle East, Europe and the UK.
