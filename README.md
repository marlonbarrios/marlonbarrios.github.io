## Bio

I have been fascinated by complex and networked systems, the web and online-community development. For more than 20 years, as a dancer, digital artist and educator, I have always been interested in building systems with rules and software, creating community platforms and establishing collaborations. I have always been driven by curiosity and my capacity to see the whole and its parts. I have learned to move fast and efficiently from large scale problems, such as networks to the specificities of software implementation. I have lots of collaborative experience envisioning, engineering, coordinating and passion for deploying cutting edge international projects intersecting software, culture and people. I am fascinated by the potential of the blockchain for financial inclusion and innovation. I am a graduate of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program (December 2021) and a Kernel Fellow Block5 2022. I love creative coding and I teach vipassana meditation and yoga.

## REACT Music Player



<img width="1516" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-25 at 10 53 08 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/170292444-0584f207-c259-4524-a7c2-abfff5f197d3.png">


I developed this React.js web app for the group to share music adding YouTube muic video and music from SounCloud. The video are added to a list fetching the thunbnail, name and artist data. The user may play them loading the songs in the player and also may create a queue. The personal queue us handled in the browser and the main list and data is managed by Apollo/GraphQR in Hasura/Heroku. You may add some tracks and share the noise!

## CryptoMondrian

CryptoMondrian is a desktop App that displays the top 10 cryptocurrencies names and prices in dollars using a CSS grid system inspired by the work of Piet Mondrian. The name and the price are placed in descendent order from the largest to the smaller blocks. The data is fetched using the CoinGecko API. User can click button and refresh data or wait until the data is refreshes every 60 seconds.

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is vast, fast growing and can be daunting and disorienting. lovethycrypto is a MERN app that offers the users a stream of the main 250 cryptocurrencies sorted by Market Cap. After logged in, the user is able to select a set of currencies to a personal list with links to a currency page with more information and external links to global news and Youtube searches about the showcased currency. All data is updated dynamically; app was deployed using Google Firebase authentication and consumes a third party API.

## Futures Thinking

We were inspired by the Futures Thinking discipline, as an approach to creative and exploratory process that uses divergent thinking, seeking many possible answers and acknowledging uncertainty. It's a different mind-set to analytical thinking which uses convergent thinking to seek the right answer and reduce uncertainty. In Futures Thinking, the user is prompted to complete the phrase: "In the future...".

## CREATIVE CODING AND GENERATIVE ART

![Screen Shot 2022-05-24 at 9 05 50 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/170304140-15ee0f3b-e0d8-44fe-9d0a-8a186422cac0.png)

This is a collection with fun projects using p5.js exploring simulation of complex systems and emergence properties aith autonomous agents and interactivity.
Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the generative system represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.
Creative coding is a type of computer programming in which the goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional. It is used to create live visuals and for VJing, as well as creating visual art and design, entertainment (e.g. video games), art installations, projections and projection mapping, sound art, advertising, product prototypes, and much more.

I created this image centric web/mobile porfolio for the videographer Daniel Van Note. He wanted a very elegant and minimalistic protfolio website with a will feature the rich imnagery of his commercial and artistic work. I developed a site modifying the Gatsby/React.js 'Starter Portfolio: Jodie' code and content managed in Markdown.

# Web3/Web2 Online Communities Projects

## MotionDAO

![31c98a5e05fee9aa7d9898ef4a1e14558ead6840](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/170337857-32e586d6-89d8-47c4-84bb-8be3bcaafb8d.png)

As a founder and leader of MotionDAO the founder, I facilitate contexts of adoption and creative experimentation using Web3 technologies; investigating its impacts on ownership, governance and value creation within local and global communities of artists; MotionDAO operates supported and supporting the social networks dance-tech.net and movimiento.org. MotionDAO is part of the Near Protocol ecosystem.

[MotionDAO in Notion](https://olive-continent-a23.notion.site/MotionDAO-A-WEB3-Dancing-Ecosystem-6e9b46865dcd4021a1d4077fcffb9f3f 'MotionDAO')


## Dance-tech.net Project
![Dance-tech.net](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90220317/170344274-3d451c01-4942-41fa-8fa1-79a9d3ddd3dc.png)

I have developed and curated social networks since 2008. The dance-tech,ne (English) and movimiento.org (in Spanish and Portuguese) have explored the potential of the new Internet technologies for knowledge production and distribution on body based artistic practices and it's intersections with other disciplines such as new media, architecture, philosophy, anthropology and more. All dance-tech projects attempt to situate embodiment as a fundamental condition and movement arts relevant practices of the contemporary with an interdisciplinary framework.
